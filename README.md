# Alx/Holberton School Advanced Html 

### Hi everyone!

I recently completed an Advanced HTML course, and I wanted to share what I learned with you all.

In this course, I learned about semantic HTML tags, which are tags that provide meaning to the content on a webpage. For example, the <header> tag indicates that the content inside it is the header of a webpage, while the <footer> tag indicates that the content inside it is the footer of a webpage.

I also learned about HTML5 structural elements, which are new tags introduced in HTML5 that help to define the structure of a webpage. These include tags such as <header>, <footer>, <main>, and <article>.

Another topic covered in the course was audio and video embedding. I learned how to use the <audio> and <video> tags to embed audio and video files into a webpage, as well as how to customize the player controls and add captions.

In addition to these topics, I also learned about form validation and web storage. Form validation is the process of checking that a form has been filled out correctly, while web storage allows us to store data locally in a user's web browser.

Overall, I feel much more confident in my HTML skills now that I've completed this advanced course. I hope this information is useful for those of you who are also interested in learning more about HTML!
