# Alx/Holberton Software Engineering  School Advanced Html 

### Hi everyone!

I recently completed an Advanced HTML course with Alx/Holberton, and I wanted to share what I learned with you all.

In this sprint, I learned about semantic HTML tags, which are tags that provide meaning to the content on a webpage. For example, the <header> tag indicates that the content inside it is the header of a webpage, while the <footer> tag indicates that the content inside it is the footer of a webpage.

Overall, I feel much more confident in my HTML skills now that I've completed this advanced course. I hope this information is useful for those of you who are also interested in learning more about HTML!
  
 ## Some of the topics covered in this Advanced HTML course include:
* Semantic HTML tags
* HTML5 structural elements
* Audio and video embedding
* Form validation
* Web storage
* Responsive design techniques
* Web accessibility
* Advanced CSS techniques for styling HTML elements
* Working with APIs to retrieve and display data on a webpage
* Advanced JavaScript techniques for manipulating the DOM and creating interactive elements
* Working with libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, python, or React to build more complex web applications
* Advanced techniques for optimizing the performance of a webpage.
